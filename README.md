# To-Do List
A simple plugin that manages a simple to-do list for servers. This plugin can be used by everyone, or, configured for only specific players. There are no dependcies required.
# Usage
- /todolist - Lists your tasks in chronological order, with a numerical ID along the left margin
- /todo < task > - Will add a task to your to-do list
- /done < task/id > - Will mark a task as done and remove it
- /todolist notify - Toggles the message about how many tasks you have when joining the server
- /todolist < player > - Allows anyone with the todolist.others permission to view others' to-do lists
# Purpose
I originally thought of this as an easy way to manage my projects, primarily due to how easily I get distracted and forget what I need to do. I wanted this plugin to simply list tasks (I used to use Essentials' /mail send <_R_T_> to make notes, which kept nagging that I had unread mail). I was planning on using this plugin exclusively on my server `play.abyssalvoid.uk.to` (Shameless Plug ðŸ˜€), however, thought that a little plugin which handled tasks would go un-noticed.
# Configuration
- /todo Make the plugin itself
- /todo Make the configuration for the plugin
